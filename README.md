# 75DaysOfDevOps-Challenge
A self-driven 75-day DevOps learning challenge where I document daily progress, hands-on labs, concepts, and tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and more. This repository serves as my public learning journal to build consistency, deepen my knowledge, and share insights with the tech community.

This repository tracks my daily journey through the world of DevOps over the next 75 days. As part of this challenge, I’m diving deep into essential DevOps tools, methodologies, and best practices. From setting up Virtual Machines to mastering CI/CD pipelines, containers, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC), this repo will capture everything I learn and implement during this hands-on journey.

What you’ll find here:

Daily Logs: Each day, I’ll document what I studied, the tools I experimented with, and the lessons I learned.

Hands-on Code: Scripts, configurations, commands, and screenshots of live demos.

Key Insights: Summaries of complex DevOps concepts in easy-to-understand formats.

Challenges and Solutions: Real-world problems I faced while practicing DevOps, with solutions I found.

The tools & topics covered will include (but are not limited to):

Virtual Machines, Linux, and Shell Scripting

Git, GitHub, and Version Control

Jenkins, CI/CD Pipelines

Docker, Kubernetes, and Containerization

Terraform, Cloud Infrastructure Automation

Monitoring Tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

Cloud Services (AWS, Azure)

My goal with this challenge is not only to enhance my own DevOps skills but to share valuable insights with anyone on a similar learning path. Feel free to explore, contribute, or even start your own challenge!
