🚀 75 Days DevOps Challenge – Day 2/75
Learning EC2, Automation & Real DevOps Perspective

Hey LinkedIn Fam! 👋

Today was all about diving deeper into the DevOps mindset — not just learning tools, but thinking at scale.

🖥️ What I Learned:
✅ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
I explored how EC2 lets us launch scalable virtual machines in the cloud, perfect for running applications and services. I manually created a VM, understood instance types, key pairs, security groups, and SSH access.

But here’s the twist...

💡 DevOps Perspective: “Clicking 100 times ≠ DevOps” 😅
Imagine your company wants to launch 100 EC2 instances.
As a DevOps Engineer, you don’t do it manually — you automate it!

Here’s how you can automate EC2 creation:

✅ AWS CLI – Command-line tool to manage AWS resources

✅ AWS SDK / API – Code-level control using Python (boto3), JavaScript, etc.

✅ AWS CloudFormation – Infrastructure as Code using YAML/JSON

✅ AWS CDK – Define infrastructure using programming languages like TypeScript/Python

✅ Terraform – Tool-agnostic IaC, powerful for multi-cloud deployments

🔁 Automation = Scalability + Consistency + Speed

📘 Continued SDLC Exploration
I also revisited the Software Development Life Cycle, focusing on how DevOps supports faster iterations between development, testing, deployment, and monitoring through automation and collaboration.

🧠 Key Takeaway:
“Being a DevOps Engineer means thinking in code — even for infrastructure.”

📍 Up Next (Day 3): I’ll get hands-on with AWS CLI and write my first EC2 automation script!

Let’s connect if you’re on your own DevOps journey or want to geek out over IaC! 🤝
