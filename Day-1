ðŸš€ 75 Days DevOps Challenge â€“ Day 1/75
Introduction & Motivation
Hey LinkedIn Family! ðŸ‘‹
Today Iâ€™m starting my 75 Days DevOps Challenge â€“ a personal commitment to consistently learn, build, and share one DevOps concept each day for the next 75 days.
 Whether you're a beginner, a student, or working in tech, I invite you to join me in this journey.
ðŸ’¡ Why Iâ€™m doing this:
- To stay consistent in my DevOps learning
- To document my progress publicly (accountability!)
- To give back to the community by sharing practical knowledge
- To improve my writing and communication skills in tech
ðŸ“š What you can expect:
Every day, Iâ€™ll post what I studied and learned â€” tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring, and more â€” with real commands, screenshots, YAML files, and lessons.
